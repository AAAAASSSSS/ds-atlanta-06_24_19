# Mod 3 Project Instructions


## Congratulations! 

You have made it half way through the course work!

## The Project
**The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and 
use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that 
can be of value to a company.**

## Data Source
- For this project, you may work with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft 
containing data from a fictional company. You probably remember the Northwind database from our section on Advanced SQL. 
Here's the schema for the Northwind database:
[Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/Northwind_ERD_updated.png)
- You can also use data of your own finding that is interesting. This should be in the form of a database if possible, but please find a data set that will lead to interesting hypothesis(questions)
  - if you find data you think is helpful, please feel free to ask for instructor help via Slack.



## Deliverables
Your team must prepare a 5 minute presentation that gives the other team members insights as to what features they should focus on to impact hospital readmission. Your presentation must outline the process you went through and use at least 4 meaningful data visualizations to help illustrate your findings. Your team is expected to use git as a collaborative tool for this project to manage version control and history.  No more than 8 slides.

Be prepared to answer questions such as:
- "how did you pick the question(s) that you did?"
- "why are these questions important from a business and/or healthcare perspective?"
- "how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
- "why did you choose a given method or library?"
- "why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"

## Project Checklist:

 - [ ] Use the data given
   - [ ] Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
   - [ ] Clean dataset & record parameters used to clean the data
     - [ ] You may use Pandas or Python functions
     - [ ] **Document every step of the cleaning process**
     - [ ] Create **at least two** new features that were not present in the original data sets
 - [ ] Use Pandas and Numpy to generate useful metrics for readmission

 - [ ] Posted to git repository:
   - [ ] A README.md listing project members, goals, responsibilities, and a summary of the files in the repository
   - [ ] At least 10 commits
     - [ ] Must include short, descriptive commit messages
     - [ ] Each project member should commit at least once
   - [ ] A Jupyter notebook targeted to a technical audience that contains
     - [ ] Clean and commented code so an independent party can replicate your analysis and justify your analytical choices
   - [ ] Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
   - [ ] A narrative Jupyter notebook targeted to a non-technical audience that provides:
     - [ ] The purpose of your analysis and why it matters
     - [ ] 4 well annotated visualizations created using Matplotlib/Seaborn
     - [ ] 2 meaningful summary tables
     - [ ] **At least two actionable insights** 
   - [ ] A pdf of no more than 8 slides used in project presentation targeting non-technical audience
     - [ ] Apply consistent and effective formatting to create a “professional” appearance
     - [ ] Write an abbreviated high-level overview of methodology
     - [ ] Justify **at least 2** concrete recommendations 
     - [ ] include exported visualizations from analysis
     - [ ] Target the presentation to a non-technical audience, avoid jargon
     - [ ] Take no more than 5 minutes to present

### Project Review
If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are uncovered, be prepared to do one or all of the following:
 - Perform additional data cleanup, visualization, and/or feature selection 
 - Submit an improved version
 - Meet again for another Project Presentation
 
What won't happen:
 - You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
 - You won't be put on the spot without support
 - There's nothing you can do to instantly blow it
